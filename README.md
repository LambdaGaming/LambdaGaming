# About Me:
I like to code in my free time. I mainly make mods and addons for games but I've also made a few standalone programs. All of my released projects are open source and can be found here on GitHub. Some of my projects can also be downloaded from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136556075/myworkshopfiles). If you would like to contact me for any reason the fastest way to get a response is to either add me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136556075) or join the [Lambda Gaming Discord](https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2).
